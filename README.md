# ‚úÇÔ∏è wtpsplit-lite

ü™ì [wtpsplit](https://github.com/segment-any-text/wtpsplit) is a Python package that offers training, inference, and evaluation of state-of-the-art Segment any Text (SaT) models for partitioning text into sentences.

‚úÇÔ∏è [wtpsplit-lite](https://github.com/superlinear-ai/wtpsplit-lite) is a lightweight version of wtsplit that only retains accelerated ONNX inference of SaT models with minimal dependencies:

1. [huggingface-hub](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub) to download the model
2. [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) to process the model in- and output
3. [onnxruntime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) to run the model
4. [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) to tokenize the text for the model

## Installing

To install this package, run:

```sh
pip install wtpsplit-lite
```

## Using

> [!TIP]
> For a complete list of Segment any Text (SaT) models and all `SaT.split` keyword arguments, see the [wtsplit README](https://github.com/segment-any-text/wtpsplit).

Example usage:

```python
from wtpsplit_lite import SaT

text = """
It is known that Maxwell‚Äôs electrodynamics‚Äîas usually understood at the
present time‚Äîwhen applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do
not appear to be inherent in the phenomena. Take, for example, the recipro-
cal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a conductor.
"""

# Fast (~150ms/page), good quality:
sat = SaT("sat-3l-sm")
sentences = sat.split(text, stride=128, block_size=256)

# Slow, highest quality:
sat = SaT("sat-12l-sm")
sentences = sat.split(text)
```

This package also [contributes a new 'hat' weighting scheme to wtpsplit](https://github.com/segment-any-text/wtpsplit/pull/147) that improves output quality when using large strides. To enable it, set `weighting="hat"` as follows:

```python
# Fast (~150ms/page), better quality:
sat = SaT("sat-3l-sm")
sentences = sat.split(text, stride=128, block_size=256, weighting="hat")
```

> [!NOTE]
> In wtpsplit, the SaT implementation treats newlines as sentence boundaries by default. However, this leads to poor results on text extracted from PDF such as in the example above. In wtpsplit-lite, newlines are therefore treated as whitepace by default. You can choose which behavior you prefer with the `treat_newline_as_space` boolean keyword argument of the `SaT.split` method.
